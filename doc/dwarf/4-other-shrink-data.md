### 5.4.5 Shrinking Dwarf data 

The encoding schemes used by Dwarf significantly reduce the size of the debugging information compared to the Dwarf v1. But unfortunately, many programs’ debugging information generated by compilers still can be very large, frequently larger than the executable code and data. 

Dwarf offers ways to further reduce the size of the debugging data. This part could be neglected here for now, as far as I am concerned.
